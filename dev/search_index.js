We also consider the rewriting of graphs, Petri nets, and 2D semisimplicial sets (which are all instances of rewriting in C-set categories) in addition to rewriting C-set slice categories and structured cospans of C-sets. Future work will allow us to perform rewriting of diagrams in C-set categories.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Double-pushout-rewriting-of-graphs","page":"AlgebraicRewriting.jl","title":"Double pushout rewriting of graphs","text":"","category":"section"}]
