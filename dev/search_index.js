This models wolves in sheeps living in a periodic 2-D space, which is also covered by grass. Wolves eat sheep to gain energy, sheep eat grass to gain energy, and grass takes time to grow back after it has been eaten. Each wolf/sheep has a direction and is moving in that direction (veering left or right randomly with some probability). At some rate, wolves/sheep undergo mitosis and their energy is split in half. As the wolves/sheep move, they lose energy, and they die if they are eaten or run out of energy.
