AlgebraicRewriting.jl is a Julia library for performing category-theoretic rewrites over a broad class of data structures, defined in [Catlab.jl](https://github.com/AlgebraicJulia/Catlab.jl). This package defines DPO, SPO, and SqPO for C-Sets, as described in [[Brown 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03784)].
