# AlgebraicRewriting.jl

Although literate documentation is forthcoming, at present one can get a sense 
of AlgebraicRewriting by checking out

- [full demo](full_demo.jl): a small demonstration of most of the major features 
  of AlgebraicRewriting.
- [Lotka Volterra example](lotka_volterra.jl): a model based 
  on NetLogo's [wolf-sheep predation](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/WolfSheepPredation) agent-based model demo.
- [Game of Life example]([GameOfLife.jl](https://nbviewer.org/github/AlgebraicJulia/AlgebraicRewriting.jl/blob/main/docs/src/GameOfLife.ipynb)): an implementation of Conway's 
  [game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) on an 
  arbitrary graph (with the grid-structure as a special case).
