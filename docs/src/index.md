# AlgebraicRewriting.jl

Here we walk through basic examples of double-pushout (DPO), single-pushout (SPO), and sesqui-pushout (SqPO) rewriting. We also consider the rewriting of graphs, Petri nets, and 2D semisimplicial sets (which are all instances of rewriting in C-set categories) in addition to rewriting C-set slice categories and structured cospans of C-sets. Future work will allow us to perform rewriting of diagrams in C-set categories.
